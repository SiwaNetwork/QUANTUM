# FPGA Binary Sources
The FPGA design based on NetTimeLogic Cores is available as binary-only (bitstream) specifically for the Timecard, which however can be used free of charge without restrictions.

The binaries are for two different hardware versions available:

- **Production** 

- **SOM** (System On Module)


More details can be found in the subfolders.
