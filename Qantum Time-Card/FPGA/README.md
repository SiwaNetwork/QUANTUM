# Time-Card FPGA Designs
The FPGA design of the Time-Card is available in two different versions.
Functional wise they are very similar (same register set etc.) but the licensing is different.

More details can be found in the subfolders:

- **Binary**:
The FPGA design is available as binary-only (bitstream) specifically for the Timecard, which however can be used free of charge without restrictions.
This design is a combination of NetTimeLogic IP cores, Xilinx IP cores and custom cores.

- **Open-Source**:
This design is a combination of Open-Source IP cores, Xilinx IP cores and custom cores.
The Open-Source IP cores are available as VHDL source code. Everything to create the full project is available.
