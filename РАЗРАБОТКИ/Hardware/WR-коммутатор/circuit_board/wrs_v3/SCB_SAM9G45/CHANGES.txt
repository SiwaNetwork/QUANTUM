	* Added LVPECL to LVTTL translator at the output 
	* CLK0 input of IC12 changed to OUT6 of AD9516
	* FPGA VCCO Bank 26 changed to +2V5 to use LVPECL and LVDS

 * FPGA Banks 26, 36 and 25 moved to "PFGA_Peripherals_Control" sheet. 
 * Connected the 3 free buffers SN74LVT125DW to the EXTPPSOUT output signal.

PCB:
------

 * GTX_DIFF signals routed on 90um/160um in order to reduce space, allowing to pass between vias
 * Some vias were moved from pads of some components to avoid the solder paste flooding by the v√≠a. 
 * IVT3200 VCO was moved to separate it of NAND Flash IC
