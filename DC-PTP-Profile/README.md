# Data Center PTP Profile â„– 1.1



### Nov 2022


## Executive Summary

This document defines a PTP profile to support time-sensitive applications within a data center environment.
The document is developed within the Open Compute Project (OCP) Timing Appliances Project community [1].
The PTP profile is based on IEEE Std 1588^ TM- 2019 [2]. When applicable, the profile also references and reuses
information from other PTP profiles or other industry specifications. The document provides a set of
requirements for implementing, deploying, and operating timing appliances within a data center. A timing
appliance is an element that is PTP-aware such as a switch/router, time server, NIC card, software module,
timing card, monitoring device, etc.
